### Insightly Resource Retrieval

This package is used to retrieve resource data from [Insight.ly](http://Insightly.com) such as Users, Organisations, Contacts and Events.

#### Installation
`meteor add fourquet:insightly `

#### Usage
Please refer to the [example](https://github.com/fourquet/meteor-package-insightly) Meteor app for basic usage.

#### Important note:
This package is not set up to retrieve every type of resource Insightly offers (ex: File Attachments). If you need to connect to Insightly, the recommended way would be to fork and update this repository. Consult the official [Insightly API](https://api.insight.ly/v2/Help) to add functions to access resources which are not available with how this package is set up.
